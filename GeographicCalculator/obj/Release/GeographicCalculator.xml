 NavigationHelper aids in navigation between pages.  It provides commands used to 
 navigate back and forward as well as registers for standard mouse and keyboard 
 shortcuts used to go back and forward in Windows and the hardware back button in
 Windows Phone.  In addition it integrates SuspensionManger to handle process lifetime
 management and state management when navigating between pages.
 </summary>
	<remarks>
		<example>
 To make use of NavigationHelper, follow these two steps or
 start with a BasicPage or any other Page item template other than BlankPage.
 
 1) Create an instance of the NaivgationHelper somewhere such as in the 
     constructor for the page and register a callback for the LoadState and 
     SaveState events.
 <code>
     Public NotInheritable Class MyPage
         Inherits Page
 
         Public Sub New()
             InitializeComponent();
             Me._navigationHelper = New Common.NavigationHelper(Me)
             AddHandler Me._navigationHelper.LoadState, AddressOf NavigationHelper_LoadState
             AddHandler Me._navigationHelper.SaveState, AddressOf NavigationHelper_SaveState
         End Sub
     
     Private Sub NavigationHelper_LoadState(sender As Object, e As Common.LoadStateEventArgs)
     End Sub
 
     Private Sub NavigationHelper_SaveState(sender As Object, e As Common.SaveStateEventArgs)
     End Sub
 </code>
 
 2) Register the page to call into the NavigationHelper whenever the page participates 
     in navigation by overriding the <see cref="M:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedTo(Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs)"/> 
     and <see cref="M:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedFrom(Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs)"/> events.
 <code>
     Protected Overrides Sub OnNavigatedTo(e As NavigationEventArgs)
         _navigationHelper.OnNavigatedTo(e)
     
     Protected Overrides Sub OnNavigatedFrom(e As NavigationEventArgs)
         _navigationHelper.OnNavigatedFrom(e)
 </code>
